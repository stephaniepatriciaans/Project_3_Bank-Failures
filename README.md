Project 3

Team members: Ryan Lund, Hamid Nazari, Joseph Gonzalez, Lu Ye, Stephanie Patricia

Project 3 theme:

Identify bank failures that have occurred over the last 3 U.S. Recessions and the year that followed the Recession. The Recessions and time periods are: 'Dot com' Recession: 2000,2001; 'Great Recession': 2008,2009; and 'COVID Recession': 2020, 2021.
Map the bank failures over a map of the U.S. Unique overlays and tiles will be found and used in this project.
Have a 'filter' on the map to select from the three Recessionary time periods. Each Recession will be color coded with markers.
Each marker will show the following data (not limited to this data): Bank name, Date of bank failure, Population & people in the surrounding area; Educational attainment level (defined as Bachelor's degree or higher) in the surrounding area; and Homeownership rate of the surrounding area.
Note: Homeownership rate will be calculated by dividing the total number of houses by the number of owner-occupied units in a given area. Both the homeownership rate and Balchelor's or higher rate will be reported for each area in which the data was available on the US. Census.
